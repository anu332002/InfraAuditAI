# DevOps Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the DevOps pipeline for the InfraAuditAI project, detailing the stages involved in the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment phases, ensuring that code changes are efficiently integrated and delivered to production.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Source Code Management**
   - The source code is hosted in a Git repository. Code changes are tracked, and a webhook is configured to trigger the pipeline on each commit.

2. **Build Stage**
   - The build process is initiated by Jenkins, which pulls the latest code from the repository.
   - A Docker image is built using the `Dockerfile` located in the `docker` directory. This image contains all necessary dependencies and the application code.

3. **Test Stage**
   - Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality. Tests are defined in the `src/tests` directory and are run using a testing framework (e.g., pytest).
   - If any tests fail, the pipeline stops, and notifications are sent to the development team.

4. **Static Code Analysis**
   - The code is scanned for vulnerabilities and compliance issues using tools like Checkov. The configuration for Checkov is defined in `scanner/checkov_config.yaml`.
   - Results of the scan are stored in `reports/latest_scan.json`, providing insights into any issues found.

5. **Deployment Stage**
   - Upon successful completion of the build and test stages, the application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Deployment manifests are located in `configs/kubernetes/deployment.yaml` and `configs/kubernetes/service.yaml`, which define how the application should be deployed and exposed.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - After deployment, monitoring is set up using Prometheus, with configurations found in `configs/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
   - Logs are collected and managed to ensure visibility into application performance and health.

7. **Feedback Loop**
   - Continuous feedback is provided to the development team through monitoring dashboards and alerts configured in Grafana, as defined in `configs/prometheus/grafana_dashboard.json`.

## Conclusion

The InfraAuditAI DevOps pipeline is designed to streamline the development process, reduce manual errors, and enhance the reliability of deployments. By automating the build, test, and deployment phases, the project aims to improve overall efficiency and accelerate time-to-market for new features and updates.
