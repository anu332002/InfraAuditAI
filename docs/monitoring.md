# Monitoring and Logging in InfraAuditAI

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring and logging strategy for the InfraAuditAI project. Effective monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining the health of the application and ensuring that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

## Monitoring

### Prometheus

Prometheus is used for monitoring the application and infrastructure. It collects metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, evaluates rule expressions, and can trigger alerts if certain conditions are met.

#### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Application performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates)
- Resource utilization metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Custom application metrics (e.g., business-specific KPIs)

### Grafana

Grafana is used for visualizing the metrics collected by Prometheus. Dashboards can be created to provide insights into the application's performance and health.

#### Dashboard Examples

- Application performance dashboard
- Resource utilization dashboard
- Alerting dashboard for critical metrics

## Logging

### ELK Stack

The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for centralized logging. It allows for the aggregation, storage, and visualization of logs from various sources.

## Alerts and Notifications

Set up alerts based on the metrics collected by Prometheus. Notifications can be sent via email, Slack, or other communication channels to inform the team of critical issues.

## Conclusion

Implementing a robust monitoring and logging strategy is essential for the InfraAuditAI project. By leveraging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack, the team can ensure that the application remains healthy and that any issues are promptly addressed.
